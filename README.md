# SimuNet
- Simulation of a Mathematical Model for Maintenance Cost Management using Artificial Neural Network
- This was initially developed as a Student Project report in partial fulfillment of the MSc degree in Mechatronics at the University of Siegen
- The original artificial neural networks were designed using Neuroph Studio. However, this is an updated version using Python and Keras.
- The report is available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.16149.13281
